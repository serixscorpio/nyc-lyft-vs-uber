# Build and create a Python job in Google Cloud Run

This is a minimal setup to run a [python job in Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/jobs/build-create-python).   This example **deploys from source**, which automatically packages code into a container image, uploads the container image to *Artifact Registry*, and then deploys to Cloud Run.
